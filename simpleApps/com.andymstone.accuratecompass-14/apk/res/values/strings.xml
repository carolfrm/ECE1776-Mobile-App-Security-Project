    <string name="instructions_message">"This compass shows the direction to magnetic north.
        
When the screen is horizontal, the compass shows the direction towards the top of the screen.  When the screen is vertical, the compass shows the direction that the back of the device is facing (i.e. the direction that your device's camera is pointing).

This app is dependent upon the accuracy of the sensors within your device. For the best results move your device away from any magnetic fields (metallic objects, electronic devices etc). Also check that you don't have a magnet on your case.

Press the menu button on your device to see more options.

This app was created by Jo and Andy at Stonekick. You can contact us at support@stonekick.com. For further information on our apps visit our website www.stonekick.com."</string>

    <string name="filtering_message">The magnetic field and accelerometer sensors in your device are of limited accuracy, even when they are well calibrated. The readings that they produce contain lots of noise, which means that the north direction that they report can vary by as much as a few degrees every second. To give a more stable (and accurate) heading, this compass applies some filtering to the sensor outputs. You can switch off this filtering to see how much of a difference it makes.</string>
